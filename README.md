# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

### Pseudocode:
- add UI/create gameboard
- event listeners for every move depending on click on different spots in gameboard grid
- add either X or O to single grid spot at a time
- take turns between x and o
- array of every spot in board grid
- add either X or O to single grid item in array at a time
- prevent spot from being chosen more than once
- determine all possible ways of winning
  - display as if statement
- display winner after x or o wins
- goal: as little global code as possible


## Outcome:

This project took me about 13 hours from start to finish over the course of half a week. This was definitely the most challenging thing I've made so far for TOP. Honestly, I doubted my abilities quite a lot at the beginning making this, as it felt like I had retained nothing and understood nothing going in. The biggest thing I worked on for this project is patience. I took many deep breaths as soon as I felt overwhelmed, and went back to review the previous lessons and all the assignments and additional resources to bring up my confidence in factory functions, IIFEs, the module pattern, etc. Then, going back to the project, I wrote out my initial pseudocode and tried to take it one piece at a time. When, still, I felt unsure how to proceed, I looked into other learners' code and videos of people making tic tac toe games, and though some parts still confused me, I felt more confident in how to proceed with my own game, (without stealing other people's work, of course). I tried a couple iterations of the JS code, trying not to do any UI or layout first per the instructions. I still ended up stuck, trying really hard to understand why each piece worked, and couldn't wrap my head around why I had to do this step in this way or put this inside this other thing. I just couldn't understand the logic myself, making it incredibly difficult to make the project if I didn't understand why I had to make it that way.

So I took another step back, and many breaks, and completely started over. Twice. On the third try, I decided to forget the instructions and make a Tic-Tac-Toe game my way. Just build out the logic the way I think it would work in my brain and try to make it. And that worked.

Since I've always been a visual learner, I decided to start with the UI instead, so I could see better what I was making as I did it (whereas the instructions said to make it in the DOM then add UI). Maybe, this isn't the "right" way to go about it, but once I did that, I just flew. Everything started to make sense, the why's and how's, and the funny thing is I unintentionally worked until I reached where I had first started, but this time I understood exactly where to go next and why I had to do those things I didn't understand the first two times. Obviously, I still hit rough patches and got stuck every now and then, but now it was mostly debugging things that I knew how to do, so I no longer lost confidence; I just kept working as I always do.

It may be a small tic-tac-toe game, but I learned a lot about the way I work and how to better approach projects in a way that works for me. I tend to get anxious and spiral when I really don't understand how or why something works, or when instructions and/or their order doesn't make sense to me, and my brain tells me it's my fault for not understanding. So, this project reminded me that I can do things my way and not force myself to follow instructions that aren't getting me anywhere. I think it's better to structure things a little differently, but get the job done, rather than waste time trying to do things "the right way" and potentially give up completely. With time and more practice, I'm sure I'll better understand the things I couldn't fully this time, and become a much better programmer than if I had forced myself to stick with the "right" path, not really learning or moving forward.
